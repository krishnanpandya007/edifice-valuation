                The fair value delineated above finds its application in a theoretical realm of an ideal market scenario. However, 
                when the scenario shifts to circumstances where a financial institution seeks to recuperate its outstanding dues by 
                initiating property sale proceedings, the aforementioned market price might not be directly applicable. This is due 
                to the conventional nature of property payments, often spread out across a duration and paid through instalments. 
                Yet, when a lender seeks to sell a property under enforcement, the expectation is for an immediate, lump-sum 
                payment. However, this alignment might not be viable within an imperfect property market context. It's widely 
                acknowledged that sales orchestrated by enforcing authorities often yield a value significantly lower than what the 
                market could command. This discrepancy between the market price and the realised sale price becomes more 
                pronounced. This contrast essentially stems from factors such as market dynamics, borrower cooperation, and 
                prevailing market conditions, all contributing to the gap between perceived and realised values.<br><br>
                
                The determination of the appropriate discount for a particular property hinges on a multitude of variables, 
                including but not limited to market influences, borrower's stance, property marketability, and prevailing conditions. 
                As we delve into the specific property under consideration, our perspective leads us to opine that the forced sale 
                value could likely hover between 20% to 30% below the market value. In light of these considerations, an average 
                discount of approximately 25% is prudent for the purpose of this valuation.<br><br>
                
                Thus, based on our assessment, the estimated forced sale or distress value of the subject property amounts to 
                {{ site.calculated_fields.distress_value_final }}. This value encapsulates a careful synthesis of market realities, borrower behaviour, and 
                the unique circumstances surrounding the sale.
